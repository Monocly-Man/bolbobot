# bolbobot
A discord frame data bot for Absolver.
Currently running version 1.1, using Python 3.9.

Frame data acquired from [SloClap's official frame data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/137K5enErK3GuWo9dLuOe7m4teMnJuutmK8wtAZx7sW0/edit#gid=702127089), [J0ker's frame data sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkZQ5s955sMQFkMig2lGBEh6R2JJNg9P/view), and my own personal knowledge.

This bot is inspired and based on the [old Tekken 7 frame bot](https://github.com/BKNR/mokujin) by BKNR.
